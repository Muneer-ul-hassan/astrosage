1. Tech Stack Overview
Backend:
FastAPI (Python): Fast, modern, and easy-to-use for building APIs.

Uvicorn: ASGI server for serving FastAPI.

Pydantic: For data validation and parsing.

Data Sources:
NASA Exoplanet Archive: Access real-time exoplanet data.

TESS API: Provides exoplanet data collected by NASA's TESS mission.

Kepler Data: You can scrape or download the data from the NASA archives.

Visualization:
Matplotlib: For simple charts.

Plotly: Interactive graphs with zoom, hover, etc.

D3.js: For more advanced visualizations (optional for web-based interactivity).

2. API Endpoints and Visualization
We'll focus on the Exoplanet Discovery API with added visualization capabilities. Here's how we can structure it:

Endpoint 1: Get Exoplanet Details
Retrieve detailed information about a specific exoplanet.

Endpoint: /exoplanet/{name}

Visualization: Generate a bar chart comparing the size, temperature, and distance of the planet to Earth.

json

Edit
{
  "name": "Kepler-452b",
  "size_comparison": {
    "earth_radius": 1.63,
    "earth_temperature": 345,
    "earth_distance": 1400
  },
  "discovery_method": "Transit",
  "orbital_period": "384 days"
}
Visualization Idea: A bar chart that compares Kepler-452b’s size, temperature, and distance to Earth. This can help users visualize how this exoplanet compares to our home planet.

Endpoint 2: Get Exoplanets by Habitability
Retrieve potentially habitable exoplanets.

Endpoint: /exoplanets/habitable

Visualization: Display a scatter plot of habitability scores vs. distance from Earth. You could use color coding to indicate how habitable a planet is.

Edit
[
  {
    "name": "Kepler-186f",
    "habitability_score": 0.95,
    "distance": 500
  },
  {
    "name": "Proxima b",
    "habitability_score": 0.89,
    "distance": 4.2
  }
]
Visualization Idea: A scatter plot showing planets with higher habitability scores and proximity to Earth.

Endpoint 3: Exoplanet Discoveries Timeline
List exoplanets discovered in the last year.

Endpoint: /exoplanets/discovered/last-year

Visualization: Create a timeline visualization showing the discoveries by month.

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "name": "Kepler-1647b",
    "discovery_date": "2024-04-01"
  },
  {
    "name": "Kepler-22b",
    "discovery_date": "2024-02-14"
  }
]
Visualization Idea: A timeline chart showing when each exoplanet was discovered and how discoveries have been made over time.

3. FastAPI + Visualization Example
Let’s say we want to set up a basic endpoint to retrieve exoplanet data and render a graph. Here's a simple example:

Step 1: Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn matplotlib plotly
Step 2: FastAPI Code to Handle the API
Create a file called main.py for your FastAPI backend:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import io
import base64
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

class Exoplanet(BaseModel):
    name: str
    distance: float
    habitability_score: float
    size_comparison: dict

@app.get("/exoplanet/{name}", response_model=Exoplanet)
async def get_exoplanet(name: str):
    # Example data - This could be fetched from your data source
    exoplanet = {
        "name": name,
        "distance": 1400,  # in light years
        "habitability_score": 0.76,
        "size_comparison": {"earth_radius": 1.63, "earth_temperature": 345, "earth_distance": 1400}
    }
    
    # Generate a plot comparing the exoplanet's size, temperature, and distance to Earth
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(["Size", "Temperature", "Distance"], 
           [exoplanet["size_comparison"]["earth_radius"], exoplanet["size_comparison"]["earth_temperature"], exoplanet["size_comparison"]["earth_distance"]],
           color=["blue", "orange", "green"])
    ax.set_title(f"Comparison of {exoplanet['name']} to Earth")
    plt.tight_layout()
    
    # Save the plot to a base64 string to embed in the HTML response
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(buf, format="png")
    buf.seek(0)
    img_str = base64.b64encode(buf.read()).decode('utf-8')
    
    return HTMLResponse(content=f"""
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>{exoplanet['name']} Details</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>{exoplanet['name']}</h1>
                <p>Distance: {exoplanet['distance']} light years</p>
                <p>Habitability Score: {exoplanet['habitability_score']}</p>
                <img src="data:image/png;base64,{img_str}" alt="Exoplanet Comparison">
            </body>
        </html>
    """)
Step 3: Running the Server
Run your FastAPI server:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main:app --reload
Now, if you navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/exoplanet/Kepler-452b, you will see an interactive page showing the exoplanet’s data along with a bar chart comparing its size, temperature, and distance to Earth.

Step 4: Deployment (Optional)
For deployment, you can use Render, Heroku, or Fly.io. Simply push your code to GitHub and link it to any of these platforms, which provide easy deployment options for FastAPI apps.
